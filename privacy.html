  <h1>Privacy Policy for smthmind iOS application</h1>
  
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> May 17, 2025</p>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how smthmind ("we," "our," or "the app") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our app.</p>
  
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  
  <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
  <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All thoughts, moods, tags, and other content you create in smthmind are stored locally on your device. This information never leaves your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
  
  <h3>Automatic Data Collection</h3>
  <p><strong>We Do Not Collect Data:</strong> smthmind does not automatically collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics from your device.</p>
  
  <p><strong>App Store Analytics:</strong> Basic, anonymized usage statistics (such as downloads, app launches, and crashes) may be collected by Apple through the App Store. This information is aggregated and does not identify individual users. We use this only to understand general app performance and improve user experience. For more information about Apple's privacy practices, please visit <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All data you enter is stored locally on your device using iOS CoreData. The security of this data is protected by your device's built-in security features, including any passcode, Touch ID, or Face ID you have configured.</p>
  
  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>smthmind does not use any third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or other external services that would collect or process your data.</p>
  
  <h2>Your Choices and Rights</h2>
  <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control over it. You can delete any or all of your data at any time within the app.</p>
  
  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our app does not specifically target children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
  
  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in an updated policy with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
